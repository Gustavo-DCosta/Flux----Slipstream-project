We want to make a system that allows us to see what the car sees
So we will be using a picamera v2 with a pi zero W

We made sure to pick the lowest latency hungry protocol to make sure we could have a 
good time between the car and the browser

With WebRTC on the worst case scenario we get 500ms, traveling at 50km/h that gives a difference of 7meters of what the car
sees and what we see
Explanation:
-> 50km.h = 14m.s 
-> 500ms = 0,5s if the car at 50km.h travels 14meters per second then half a second it travels 7 meters


However that is a very big difference, so we will try to keep the latency at 100ms, that gives 1 meter of difference

How does WebRTC works?

> WebRTC is both a protocol and an API, it allows bi-directional real time communication meaning that the senders talks 
with the receiver and vice-versa, the API is specified only in JS

> To make it simple the protocol consist of 4 steps or stages
    -*  Signaling
    -*  Connecting
    -*  Securing 
    -*  Communicating

They are sequesntial meaning the precedent step must be 100% working.
FUN FACT: each step is a bunch of nested protocols

We will use the method peer to peer of the WebRTC protocol
When a WebRTC agent starts, to know to whom comunicate he signales with a protocol called SDP (Session Description Protocol)

which is a plain texte protocol and has key: value pair elements 
with some media
• The IPs and Ports that the agent is reachable on (candidates).
• The number of audio and video tracks the agent wishes to send.
• The audio and video codecs each agent supports.
• The values used while connecting (uFrag/uPwd).
• The values used while securing (certificate fingerprint)

Keep in mind that those process are considered "out of band" which means that the engeneer itself has to code the layers for 
agents to talk to eachother
WebRTC doesn't care about the channell of information cross-over, we are free to use endpoints websocketps 
TCP, UDP, a piegon anything

You will use the infrasctucture of the application choossen to facilitate trading SDPs between the clients

We can't just give the other person our public adress, because of a possible FireWall a possible VPN or even NAT
Network Adress Translation

With a public adress we don't hit a device we hit a router
But STUN servers can, and google as a lot of stun servers (STUN stands for simple transversal of UDP trought NAT)
